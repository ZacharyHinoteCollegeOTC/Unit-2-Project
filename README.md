## Analysis Steps

We were required to make an interface that took an input of United States dollars and converted it to Canadian Dollars. 

I decided that a GridPane would be best suited for this, with label nodes to clarify input and output, and text field nodes to take input and display output, and finally a button labeled convert with an attached handler to set the Canadian Dollar text field to 1.5 times the first text field. 



### Design

How did you approach your program design? Did you use multiple classes to define various objects?

I broke it down into parts, first establishing the gridpane, then adding in the input and output nodes, and finally created the handler to convert input from the US Dollars Text Field into output in the Canadian Dollars text field. 

### Testing

I simply input a variety of numeric values into the text field, even negative numbers.
